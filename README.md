# Exploratory-data-analysis-1

First data assignment. Task was to pick an interesting dataset and extract insights. My choice was the data from the main race of Le Mans. Unfortunately not as interesting as I hoped for. However, the analysis clearly shows the performance difference between classes and the teams in every class. Outliers were well identified.

## Methodology
1. Web-scraping to have reference data for verification
2. Verifying the downloaded CSV file for accuracy
3. Cleaning the CSV data
4. Data exploration & visualisation
5. And some reporting during every process 

## Some of the most interesting graphs
